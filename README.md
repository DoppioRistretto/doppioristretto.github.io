:wave: Hello! My name is Brady Semm. You can also find me around as DoppioRistretto.

I've been an information security professional since 2019. I am currently working in Detection and Response but I also have interests in Web Application, Product Security, and Security Automation.

:rotating_light: See my [Projects](./projects) page to take a look at my public projects and contributions.

In what little spare time I have, I enjoy reading, writing, comic books, and Magic the Gathering.
